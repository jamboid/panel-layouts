# Advanced CSS Panel Layouts using the calc() function

This is an exploration of the CSS calc() function and how it can be used to create flexible panel layouts as part of a responsive website design.

## Origin

I started exploring the uses of calc() for dynamic layouts after being handed a UI design to code for a work project at Good.

The design featured a modular set of panel-based components that centered fixed-width content on the page, but could also align themselves to the left or right edges of the viewport. This resulted components that required dynamic padding and margins to create the desired layout.
